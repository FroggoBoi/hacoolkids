Supervised Learning - tasks where we have a metric for success, whether the data is labled or rewards are offered for performing the task well

Unsupervised Learning - refers to the problems where the model has no guidance and must infer patterns and features in the data indendently

Types of Supervised Learining:
  Classification - The model must classify input data; can be anything like flitering spam or choosing if an image is a cat or a horse
  
  Reinforcement Learning - The model interacts with a dynamic environment by observing the current state of the envinronment and rewards for good performance. Learning to play arcade games is one way to use reinforcememt learning.
  
How does a machine learning model "learn"?

First data is fed into the model. The parameters in the model take that data and return an answer.

The model's guess is then compared with the expected outcome. (Was the image a cat or a horse?)

Then the parameters are optimized in the direction of the expected outcome.

This process is repeated with new data until the model has optimized its parameters to be as likely as possible to guess the right answer.

WHAT'S IN A MODEL 

A machine learning model can be as simple as a single variable that changes over time to a whole network of thousands of neurons estimating complex processes. The more parameters a model has, the more nuanced the task it can learn becomes

Tuning your machine learning models is a matter of balancing complexity, processing time, and modle structure to be the best at its learning task.
